# The license delete endpoint invalidates OAS3.0 spec since it consumes a json payload
# source: https://github.com/portainer/portainer-ee/blob/develop/api/http/handler/licenses/licenses_delete.go#L43
# We cannot successfully validate the spec unless this endpoint is updated.

    # OpenAPI2.0 does not support multiple body params (which we utilize in some of our handlers).
    # OAS3.0 however does support multiple body params - hence its best to convert the generated OAS 2.0
    # to OAS 3.0 and validate the output of generated OAS 3.0 instead.
